# Integrated-AI-Agent
An integrated AI agent which can perform pathfinding, gameplay and logic inference

I built up 3 fundamental functions of an artificial intelligence.

Pathfinding: this agent is able to perform a greedy or heuristic pathfinding given basic map geographic data and a not bad heuristic function. Google Maps pathfinding utilized A* search. The source code has a potential to be developed into a web service. Also this agent is able to play strategy games with human. The difficulties can be set by the level of alpha-beta pruning. Nevertheless, this agent can perform first order logic resolution. which possibly could learn from input data and infer more facts based on it.

This integrated AI project is a great project to solidify DS, Algo, AI Algo, and OOP. Also, this project has a great potential to be extended to more functions, including some web-based HCI apps, or more AI functions.
